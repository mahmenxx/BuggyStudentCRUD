# 🐛 Buggy Student CRUD — Practical Lab Activity

## ASP.NET Core MVC Bug Hunting Exercise

This is a **Student Records Management System** built with ASP.NET Core 6.0 MVC and Entity Framework Core. It has been **intentionally coded with several bugs** for you to find and fix as part of your practical lab activity.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed on your machine
- A code editor (Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider)
- Git installed

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmenxx/BuggyStudentCRUD.git
cd BuggyStudentCRUD
```

### 2. Restore Packages

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
cd BuggyStudentCRUD
dotnet run
```

The app will start on `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`. Open it in your browser.

> **Note:** The app uses an **in-memory database**, so data resets every time you restart the application. Five sample students are seeded automatically.

---

## 🎯 Your Task

This application contains **7 bugs** spread across the **Model**, **Views**, and **Controllers**. Your job is to:

1. **Run the application** and test every feature
2. **Identify each bug** by observing unexpected behavior
3. **Fix each bug** in the source code
4. **Document your findings** (see Submission section below)

### Features to Test

| Feature | What to Test |
|---------|-------------|
| **Student List** | Search functionality, sorting by columns |
| **View Details** | Click on a student to see their full info |
| **Create Student** | Add a new student with valid data |
| **Edit Student** | Modify an existing student's information |
| **Delete Student** | Remove a student record |
| **Validation** | Try entering invalid data (empty fields, bad GPA values) |

### 💡 Hints

- Bugs are in the **Controller logic**, **View templates**, and **Model validation**
- Pay close attention to what happens vs. what *should* happen
- Use the browser's developer tools (F12) to inspect network requests if needed
- Read error messages carefully — they often point to the root cause
- Compare the code to what standard CRUD operations should look like

## 📝 Submission Requirements

Create a document (PDF or DOCX) with the following for **each bug** you find:

1. **Bug #**: Number it sequentially
2. **Location**: File name and line number(s)
3. **Description**: What is wrong and what incorrect behavior it causes
4. **Fix**: The corrected code
5. **Explanation**: Why the fix works

### Example:

> **Bug #1**
> - **Location:** `Controllers/ExampleController.cs`, Line 42
> - **Description:** The method returns `null` instead of a valid view, causing a 500 error
> - **Fix:** Changed `return null;` to `return View();`
> - **Explanation:** The action method must return an `IActionResult`; returning null crashes the MVC pipeline

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **DO NOT** look at the git blame or commit messages for hints about the bugs
- Work **individually** unless your instructor says otherwise
- The in-memory database means no database setup is required
- If the app crashes, read the exception message — it's a clue!
- There are exactly **7 bugs** — keep looking until you find them all

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core 6.0 MVC
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core 6.0 (In-Memory Provider)
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome 6
- **Language:** C# 10
